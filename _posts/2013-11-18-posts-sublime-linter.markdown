Linting my code has become as common as saving files in my work flow. Linting helps me produce better code and save time by tracking down potential errors or common mistakes. I first started copying and pasting huge chunks of javascript into JSHint's website, and then later relying on gruntJS to run a task to watch my javascript and lint files on save.

I recently came across a sublime text package called "Sublime Linter" which will actually lint the code I write as I type. This is pretty awesome considering all of my code is linted and ready to go before it even hits my browser. I have been using Sublime Text 2 for a little over a year now and am still realizing how powerful and versatile it can be. Here is the link to the [repo][sublimeLinter]. Sublime linter can also be installed via Sublime's package manager.
